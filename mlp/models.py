"""Model definitions.

This module implements objects encapsulating learnable models of input-output
relationships. The model objects implement methods for forward propagating
the inputs through the transformation(s) defined by the model to produce
outputs (and intermediate states) and for calculating gradients of scalar
functions of the outputs with respect to the model parameters.
