%% START of YOUR ANSWERS
%% Add answers to the questions below, by replacing the text inside the brackets {} for \youranswer{ "Text to be replaced with your answer." }. 
%
% Do not delete the commands for adding figures and tables. Instead fill in the missing values with your experiment results, and replace the images with your own respective figures.
%
% You can generally delete the placeholder text, such as for example the text "Question Figure 2 - Replace the images ..." 
%
% There are 19 TEXT QUESTIONS (a few of the short first ones have their answers added to both the Introduction and the Abstract). Replace the text inside the brackets of the command \youranswer with your answer to the question.
%
% There are also 3 "questions" to replace some placeholder FIGURES with your own, and 3 "questions" asking you to fill in the missing entries in the TABLES provided. 
%
% NOTE! that questions are ordered by the order of appearance of their answers in the text, and not by the order you should tackle them. Specifically, you cannot answer Questions 2, 3, and 4 before concluding all of the relevant experiments and analysis. Similarly, you should fill in the TABLES and FIGURES before discussing the results presented there. 
%
% NOTE! If for some reason you do not manage to produce results for some FIGURES and TABLES, then you can get partial marks by discussing your expectations of the results in the relevant TEXT QUESTIONS (for example Question 8 makes use of Table 1 and Figure 2).
%
% Please refer to the coursework specification for more details.
